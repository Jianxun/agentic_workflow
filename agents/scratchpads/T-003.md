# Task summary (DoD + verify)

## DoD
- Validation logic is factored into a reusable helper with a clear signature.
- CLI behavior is preserved while delegating to the new helper.
- Unit tests exercise valid and invalid task/state combinations.

## Verify
- python -m unittest discover -s agents/tests -p 'test_lint_tasks_state.py'

# Read (paths)
- agents/context/lessons.md
- agents/context/contract.md
- agents/context/tasks.yaml
- agents/context/tasks_state.yaml
- agents/context/project_status.md

# Plan
- Inspect current lint_tasks_state implementation and surrounding usage.
- Add helper function and unit tests with coverage for valid/invalid cases.
- Wire CLI to use helper and keep behavior unchanged.
- Run verify command and record results.

## Todo
- [x] Review lint_tasks_state implementation.
- [x] Add unit tests for valid/invalid task-state combinations.
- [x] Refactor validation into helper and preserve CLI behavior.
- [x] Run targeted unit tests.
